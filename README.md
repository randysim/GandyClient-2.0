## Project setup
After cloning the repo, run `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` to generate all files for the launching and to decompile minecraft. Then use `genIntelliJRuns` or `genEclipse` to generate the launch configuration. If this task fails, try to add a dummy configuration and re-try. This fixes the issue in most cases.
